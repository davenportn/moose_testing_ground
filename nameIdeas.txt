Ok let's do this. The name needs to be catchy and short, something easy to remember. We don't need the *perfect* name right now, but something solid would be cool.

Not taken names:
1. Book Keeper (Bookkeeper? idk)
2. Bookwatch
3. Library_________ (insert something here?)
4. Library Binding (I like this one, it's oddly fitting)

Taken names:
1. Shelves (we can't use this, it's used by our competition. no seriously, I already checked. There's a pretty solid app here, actually, something to aspire to rival, if we were to release. Fuck this is a good name though)
2. Book Catalogue
3. My Book Shelf
4. My little library
